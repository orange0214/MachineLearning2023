In this project, the application of combining neural network models with Chebyshev polynomials was explored. The emphasis was placed on the study of passive implants, whose geometric shapes are typically complex and variable. Therefore, I attempted to employ Chebyshev polynomials to effectively characterize the geometric features of these passive implants. This characterization method transforms geometric features into a series of quantifiable parameters, which can subsequently be utilized by neural network models to provide a basis for predicting the temperature rise of passive implants.

To further validate this approach, a conventional neural network was constructed, and the predictive performance of traditional neural network models was compared with those optimized using Chebyshev polynomials on different datasets. The results indicated that the neural network model optimized with Chebyshev polynomials exhibited significantly superior predictive performance compared to the traditional neural network model. This strongly emphasizes the advantages of using Chebyshev polynomials in addressing problems related to complex geometric shapes.
